= Features of GPS =

===*Better Layout Design*===
----
New bigger and redesigned layout to achieve more space and better tools location.

(all windows location are stored on the "sessionrc" file)

In order for GPS to work properly *your display should be at least 1280 x 960 pixels* though higher resolution will provide more working space. It is not uncommon to work at 1600 x 1200 pixels and higher, or even with 2 monitors.  Remember that *GPS is intended for graphic designers* and artists who typically have access to larger displays.


===*Chaos & Evolutions Brushpack included by default*===
----
I believe that GPS could have. Subsets, so the first one is Chaos & Evolutions created by David Revoy the ArtDirector of the Blender open source movie ,Sintel




===*Presets for more tools, not only painting tools*===
----
We can use more tools to do other usual tasks as Gradient effects, cropping  work ,cloning  and much more.

  * Selection Presets
  * Cropping Presets
  * Fill Presets
  * Gradient Presets
  * Pencil Presets
  * Paintbrush Presets
  * Smudge Presets
  * Airbrush Presets
  * Eraser Presets
  * Ink Tool Presets
  * Cloning Presets
  * Brush/Sharpen Presets
  * Mixbrush Presets. (only with Gimp painter)
  * G-Pen Presets. (only with Gimp painter)



===*Tag System*===
----
We have now a better way to understand where our presets are, and how they work. I have included the Blendmode of some presets. And also a type of hint by Select Gradient or Select Foreground color. That makes the presets management  faster



===*A complete pack to fit our artistic needs that includes*===
----

===*Final Words?*===
----
GIMP is a tool, and therefore it is more important who use the tool than the tool itself.Art is about that concept. It must be fun and i sure you painting with gimp and GPS is very fun.
